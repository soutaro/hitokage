# Hitokage - Faster Float#to_s

The ruby's `Float#to_s` uses [David M. Gay's library](http://www.netlib.org/fp/dtoa.c).
The implementation is based on traditional DRAGON(1)(2), one of the most well known floating point printing algorithm developed by Guy L. Steel, et al.
I recently found another floating point printing library, [google/double-conversion](https://github.com/google/double-conversion), which implements faster algorithm called Grisu(3).

This is an example using the google/double-conversion for `Float#to_s`.

### Benchmark

Grisu version is more than 4 times faster than DRAGON version, `Float#to_s`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hitokage'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hitokage

## Usage

It defines `Float#hitokage_to_s`.

```ruby
require 'hitokage'
1.0.hitokage_to_s
```

Or, you can replace the default `Float#to_s`.

```ruby
require 'hitokage/replace_float_to_s'
1.0.to_s
```

### Incompatibility

This library generates different string representation than `Float#to_s` for some values including `1e-10` and `1e10`.
However, the generated string can be converted to same float number using `to_f`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
